This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## City-Comparison

I built this project to get familiar with React and rest API concepts. I used Heroku service to get the app online (Sometimes the loading might be slow, but that's fine because it's free :) ) and you can check it out here: https://city-comparison.herokuapp.com/
